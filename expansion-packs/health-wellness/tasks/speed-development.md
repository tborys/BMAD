# Task: Speed Development

## Purpose
Design a training program focused on improving running speed and race performance for 5K to 10K distances through targeted workouts and physiological adaptations.

## Steps
1. Establish current speed baseline and race times
2. Determine target race pace and training zones
3. Plan periodized approach with base, build, and peak phases
4. Design VO2 max workouts (3-5 minute intervals)
5. Include lactate threshold training (tempo runs)
6. Add neuromuscular power work (strides, hill sprints)
7. Plan race-pace workouts and time trials
8. Include adequate recovery between hard sessions
9. Create taper strategy for peak performance
10. Design race-day pacing and tactical approach

## Output
- Speed Development Training Plan (8-12 weeks)
- Target Pace Chart and Training Zones
- Workout Library with Garmin Files
- Race Strategy and Pacing Plan
- Progress Testing Protocol

## Key Workout Types
- **VO2 Max Intervals:** 3-5 minutes at 3K-5K pace
- **Lactate Threshold:** 20-40 minute tempo runs
- **Race Pace:** Intervals at goal race pace
- **Speed:** 30-second to 2-minute fast intervals
- **Strides:** 15-20 second accelerations for form
- **Hill Repeats:** Power and strength development

## Training Zones
- **Zone 1 (Easy):** 65-75% max HR, conversational pace
- **Zone 2 (Moderate):** 75-82% max HR, comfortable hard
- **Zone 3 (Threshold):** 82-87% max HR, comfortably hard
- **Zone 4 (VO2 Max):** 87-95% max HR, hard
- **Zone 5 (Neuromuscular):** 95%+ max HR, very hard
