# Task: Ultra Marathon Preparation

## Purpose
Develop a comprehensive training and preparation strategy for ultra marathon distances (50K+), including physical training, mental preparation, and race-day logistics.

## Steps
1. Assess current endurance base and ultra running experience
2. Design progressive mileage buildup over 16-24 weeks
3. Plan back-to-back long run sessions for muscle fatigue adaptation
4. Include hill training and terrain-specific preparation
5. Develop fueling and hydration strategy for race distance
6. Practice race-day nutrition during long training runs
7. Build mental resilience and coping strategies
8. Plan equipment testing and selection
9. Create pacing strategy and race-day execution plan
10. Include recovery protocols and injury prevention

## Output
- Ultra Marathon Training Plan (16-24 weeks)
- Nutrition and Fueling Strategy
- Equipment Checklist and Testing Plan
- Race Day Execution Strategy
- Recovery and Taper Protocol

## Training Components
- **Base Building:** 12-16 weeks of aerobic development
- **Long Runs:** Progressive distance increase, back-to-back sessions
- **Hill Training:** Strength and power development for climbing
- **Speed Work:** Limited but important for efficiency
- **Cross Training:** Hiking, cycling, strength work
- **Mental Training:** Visualization, discomfort tolerance

## Nutrition Strategy
- Practice fueling every 30-45 minutes during long runs
- Test different food types and hydration systems
- Plan for potential stomach issues
- Calculate caloric needs for race day
- Develop contingency plans for nutrition failures
