# Task: Body Recomposition Planning

## Purpose
Design a sustainable approach to simultaneously lose body fat and build/maintain muscle mass, avoiding the cycle of weight fluctuation through evidence-based strategies.

## Steps
1. Assess current body composition and training history
2. Analyze past diet attempts and identify patterns of failure
3. Calculate moderate caloric deficit (300-500 calories) for sustainable fat loss
4. Design protein-prioritized nutrition approach (1g per lb body weight)
5. Plan resistance training program to preserve/build muscle
6. Include metabolic conditioning for fat burning
7. Schedule diet breaks and refeeds to prevent metabolic adaptation
8. Create habit-based approach rather than restrictive dieting
9. Plan progress tracking beyond just scale weight
10. Design long-term maintenance strategy

## Output
- Body Recomposition Blueprint
- Sustainable Nutrition Framework
- Resistance Training Program
- Progress Tracking System
- Habit Formation Plan

## Key Principles
- **Moderate Deficit:** Avoid extreme calorie restrictions that cause muscle loss
- **Protein Priority:** Maintain high protein intake throughout
- **Strength Training:** Progressive overload to build/maintain muscle
- **Patience:** Body recomposition takes longer than simple weight loss
- **Flexibility:** Allow for social eating and lifestyle balance
- **Sustainability:** Focus on habits you can maintain long-term

## Addressing Past Diet Failures
- Identify triggers that led to previous diet abandonment
- Create flexible approach that doesn't require perfection
- Build in planned breaks to prevent psychological restriction
- Focus on adding good foods rather than eliminating everything
- Create non-scale victories and progress markers
