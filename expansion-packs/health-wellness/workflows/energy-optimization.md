# Workflow: Energy Optimization

## Purpose
Optimize daily energy levels through strategic improvements in sleep, nutrition, exercise, and stress management.

## Steps
1. Energy Assessment - Evaluate current energy patterns and low-energy periods
2. Sleep Optimization (*task sleep-assessment) - Improve sleep quality and duration
3. Circadian Rhythm Alignment (*task circadian-optimization) - Sync activities with natural rhythms
4. Nutritional Energy Strategy (*agent nutritionist) - Optimize meal timing and composition
5. Exercise for Energy (*task create-workout-program) - Design movement routine for energy boost
6. Stress-Energy Connection (*task stress-assessment) - Address energy-draining stressors
7. Habit Formation (*task behavior-change-design) - Create energy-supporting daily routines
8. Environmental Design - Optimize physical spaces for energy
9. Progress Monitoring - Track energy levels and make adjustments

## Outputs
- Energy Assessment Report
- Optimized Daily Schedule
- Circadian Rhythm Plan (*template sleep-log)
- Energy-Supporting Meal Plan
- Movement for Energy Program

- Reduced afternoon energy crashes
- Better morning energy and alertness
- Sustained energy throughout the day
- Reduced dependence on caffeine/stimulants

## Required Agents
- Sleep Coach (lead agent)
- Nutritionist
- Fitness Trainer
- Stress Manager
- Habit Engineer
