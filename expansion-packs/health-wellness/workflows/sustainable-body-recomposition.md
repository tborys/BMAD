# Workflow: Sustainable Body Recomposition

## Purpose
Create a comprehensive, sustainable approach to losing body fat (especially abdominal fat) while building/maintaining muscle mass, avoiding the cycle of diet failure and weight fluctuation.

## Steps
1. **Assessment Phase** (Week 1-2)
   - Body Recomposition Planning (*task body-recomposition-planning) - Analyze past diet failures and create sustainable approach
   - Fitness Assessment (*task fitness-assessment) - Establish strength and conditioning baseline
   - Habit Analysis (*task habit-analysis) - Identify current patterns and triggers
   - Stress Assessment (*task stress-assessment) - Address emotional eating and stress factors

2. **Foundation Phase** (Week 3-6)
   - Macro Planning (*task macro-planning) - Set moderate deficit with high protein focus
   - Create Workout Program (*task create-workout-program) - Design resistance training for muscle preservation
   - Behavior Change Design (*task behavior-change-design) - Build sustainable eating habits
   - Sleep Optimization (*task sleep-assessment) - Optimize hormones for body composition

3. **Implementation Phase** (Week 7-14)
   - Progressive strength training with Garmin tracking
   - Consistent nutrition habits with flexible approach
   - Regular cardio for fat burning (running/cardio plans)
   - Weekly progress monitoring and adjustments

4. **Optimization Phase** (Week 15-20)
   - Adjust macros based on progress and metabolic adaptation
   - Implement diet breaks to prevent plateau
   - Advanced training techniques for continued progress
   - Refine habits for long-term sustainability

5. **Maintenance Phase** (Week 21+)
   - Transition to maintenance calories
   - Continued strength progression
   - Long-term habit reinforcement
   - Quarterly progress reviews

## Outputs
- Comprehensive Body Recomposition Plan
- Sustainable Nutrition Framework (*template body-recomposition-tracker)
- Progressive Strength Training Program (*template workout-program)
- Garmin-Compatible Workouts (*template garmin-training-plan)
- Habit Formation System (*template habit-tracker)
- Progress Monitoring Dashboard

## Duration
20-24 weeks initial phase, with ongoing maintenance support

## Success Metrics
- **Body Composition:** Reduce body fat % while maintaining/gaining muscle mass
- **Strength Progress:** Consistent improvement in major lifts
- **Waist Measurement:** Reduction in abdominal circumference
- **Sustainability:** Maintain habits for 6+ months without extreme restriction
- **Energy & Wellbeing:** Improved energy, mood, and overall health markers

## Key Principles for Avoiding Past Diet Failures
- **Moderate Approach:** 300-500 calorie deficit vs. extreme restriction
- **Flexible Dieting:** 80/20 rule - healthy choices most of the time
- **Strength Focus:** Prioritize muscle preservation through resistance training
- **Habit-Based:** Focus on systems and behaviors, not just outcomes
- **Regular Breaks:** Planned diet breaks every 8-12 weeks
- **Social Integration:** Plan for eating out and social situations
- **Non-Scale Victories:** Track progress beyond just weight

## Running Integration
- Include running for cardiovascular health and additional calorie burn
- Use Garmin devices for structured cardio workouts
- Balance running with strength training for optimal body composition
- Consider running goals (5K speed, longer distances) as secondary objectives

## Required Agents
- **Fitness Trainer** (lead agent) - Strength training and body composition focus
- **Nutritionist** - Sustainable eating strategies and macro management
- **Habit Engineer** - Long-term behavior change for sustainability
- **Stress Manager** - Address emotional eating and lifestyle factors
- **Sleep Coach** - Optimize hormones and recovery
- **Running Coach** - If running goals are included

## Red Flags for Past Diet Pattern
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Extreme calorie restriction
- Eliminating entire food groups
- Obsessing over daily weight fluctuations
- Social isolation due to diet restrictions
- Neglecting strength training in favor of only cardio
- Setting unrealistic timelines

## Sustainable Mindset Shift
- From "diet" to "lifestyle change"
- From "perfection" to "progress"
- From "restriction" to "addition of healthy habits"
- From "quick fix" to "long-term process"
- From "scale weight" to "body composition"
- From "willpower" to "systems and environment"
